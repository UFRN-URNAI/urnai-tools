"""
Ideas for new reward builders or improvements for current ones:

    - Use utils.sc2_utils.get_fog_of_war_percentage() as a part of a reward value.
    Ex: if the agent explored 25% of the map give some reward, if explored 50% give another
    reward, etc.

    - Try out GeneralReward again but without the constant -1, just either 0 or positive reward,
    and try and balance different scores more (for instance, food_army score is multiplied by 50
    and that may not be optimal)

    - Create a reward for researching technology, or for creating techlabs in factory, starport etc
    so we can encourage the agent to train more complex units and have better army composition
